# Investment Data Analysis Project

🎯 **Goal**  
This project is my personal journey to become a data analyst, with a focus on investment and financial data. I have no prior experience in programming, data, or finance, and I aim to build strong data analysis skills while gradually learning investment concepts.

## Project Overview

- Collect, clean, and analyze financial and investment data
- Learn and apply Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Practice visualization with Tableau or Power BI
- Explore basic investment metrics and indicators

## Folder Structure

- `/data` : Raw datasets (CSV, Excel, etc.) and processed datasets for analysis
- `/notebooks` : Jupyter notebooks with experiments and analysis
- `/scripts` : Python scripts for reusable code
- `/visualizations` : Graphs, charts, and Tableau/Power BI outputs
- `/reports` : PDF reports or analysis summaries from projects
- `/references` : Reference materials, tutorials, articles, and investment/finance resources

## Plan

1. Learn Python basics and data manipulation with Pandas
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on investment datasets
3. Visualize insights using Matplotlib/Seaborn and Tableau/Power BI
4. Experiment with simple investment metrics and portfolio analysis
5. Document progress and update GitHub regularly

## Notes

- This is a personal learning and skill-building project
- Focus is on practical experience and portfolio development
